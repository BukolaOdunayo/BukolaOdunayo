### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Bukola Ogunjimi. I'm a data analyst passionate about uncovering valuable insights from data and data storytelling. 

I am proficient in R Programming Language, SQL, Python, Excel, Google Sheets, Tableau, and Bigquery,I have ample experience using these tools for 
manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing complex data sets.
I bring a unique blend of technical skills and creative problem-solving abilities to any data challenge.

I am committed to providing insightful analysis and data-driven solutions to complex business problems. 

Currently, I am on the lookout for opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge in an Junior Data Analyst position or an Internship. My technical prowess aside, I am adept at collaborating with colleagues from different departments to achieve successful project outcomes.

SO far, I've completed  projects and internships while remaining committed to staying abreast of the latest trends and technologies in my field. I am always eager to participate in data analysis projects. Feel free to connect with me on [Linkedin](www.linkedin.com/in/ogunjimi-bukola) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Oluwabukola0).
